# puff

Works by querying whoisxmlapi.com and crt.sh

Works with or without API keys

Stuff to do:
  1. Add an option to check for alive domains;
  2. Threading (done);
  3. Beautiful README;
  4. Beautiful code;
  5. Divide the code base into several files/modules (done);
  6. Beautiful documentation;
  7. Add support for another resources/sites (partially done -> crt.sh is now supported);
  8. Create requirements.txt (done);
  9. Configurability;
  10. Easier usage in scripts (do not output not needed stuff to stdout);
  11. 9 implies that logs are needed in order to see what was going during Puffs run (add an option to store logs);
  12. Add logging of events happening while Puff is running
