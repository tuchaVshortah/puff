Works by querying whoisxmlapi.com

Works with or without API keys

Stuff to do:
  1. Add an option to check for alive domains;
  2. Beautiful README;
  3. Beautiful code formatting;
  4. Divide the code base into several files/modules;
  5. Beautiful documentation;
  6. Add support for another resources/sites;
  7. Create requirements.txt;
  8. Configurability;
  9. Easier usage in scripts (do not output not needed stuff to stdout);
  10. 9 implies that logs are needed in order to see what was going during Puffs run (add an option to store logs);
